# Prefix_Trees

A prefix tree is also known as a Trie;

it is used to optimize the search complexities. 

If we search keys or words in a Binary Search Tree (BST) then the time complexity could go up to O (M * log N),

whereas M is length of the words inserted and N is the total number of words inserted in the tree.

However, when the prefix tree is used the search time complexity is reduced to O(M).
